# React Native Boilerplate

This React Native boilerplate project is designed to accelerate your mobile app development by providing a robust starting point with built-in authentication, environment variable management, TypeScript support, and more. It includes essential tools and configurations to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Supports multiple authentication methods, including:
  - Email and password
  - Google Sign-In
  - Apple Sign-In
- **Environment Variables**: Managed with `react-native-dotenv` for secure and easy configuration.
- **Navigation**: Integrated with React Navigation for smooth screen transitions and navigation flows.
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed with TypeScript to ensure code quality and reduce runtime errors.
- **Linting and Formatting**: Configured with ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style and automatic formatting.
- **Path Aliases**: Simplifies imports using path aliases for better project structure and readability.
- **Expo Development**: Supports Expo with custom development builds using `expo-dev-client` for native modules.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (recommended for dependency management)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) for development builds and running the project
- [EAS CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/) for creating custom development builds


## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Puvvl/react-native-boilerplate.git
   cd react-native-boilerplate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

  Create a .env file in the root directory with the necessary environment variables

  

    FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
    FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
    FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
    FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
    EXPO_CLIENT_ID=your-expo-client-id
    IOS_CLIENT_ID=your-ios-client-id
    ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=your-android-client-id

### Running the App

1. **Start the development server**

  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

2. **Create a development build with EAS**

  For native modules, use EAS to create a development build

  ```bash
  eas build --profile development --platform all
  ```

  Install the generated build on your device and connect to the local dev server with

  ```bash
  yarn start --dev-client
  ```

## Available Scripts

`yarn start`: Start the development server with Expo.

`yarn android`: Run the app on an Android emulator or connected device.

`yarn ios`: Run the app on an iOS simulator or connected device.

`yarn lint`: Run ESLint to check for code style issues.

`yarn lint:fix`: Run ESLint to fix for code style issues.

`yarn format`: Run Prettier to format the code.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are managed using `react-native-dotenv`. Make sure to add a `.env` file in the root directory and configure it according to your projectâ€™s requirements. The variables include keys for Firebase configuration and client IDs for Google sign-in.

## Linting and Formatting

**ESLint**: Configured with recommended rules for React Native, TypeScript, and Prettier integration.
**Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting across the project.

## Path Aliases

Path aliases are set up to simplify imports and keep your code clean and maintainable. The aliases are defined in `babel.config.js` and `tsconfig.json` to ensure consistency across the project.
